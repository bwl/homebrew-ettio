  caveats <<~EOS
    Forest CLI is now available as 'forest' command!

    The binary has been linked to: #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/forest

    Alternatively, you can add the app bundle's CLI to your PATH:
      echo 'export PATH="$PATH:#{appdir}/Forest Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS"' >> ~/.zshrc

    Or use the GUI installer: Press âŒ˜K, type /cli-install
